The code is really sloppy. It's sloppy because I find design to be very tedious these days.
If I have to design and develop at the same time, I will never finish this. So, I am
going to just do it, and it is going to be beautiful. Just not the code. Please don't
judge the code. The code is really sloppy.

```shell
npm install
npm run build

npm install http-server --global
http-server # navigate to //localhost:port/debug.html
```
